# ESP32-CAM Video Streaming Web Server (works with Home Assistant, Node-RED, etc)

Project Page: https://RandomNerdTutorials.com/esp32-cam-video-streaming-web-server-camera-home-assistant/

In this project we’re going to build an IP surveillance camera with the ESP32-CAM board. The ESP32 camera is going to host a video streaming web server that you can access with any device in your network.

# ESP32-CAM PIR Motion Detector with Photo Capture (saves to microSD card)

Project Page: https://RandomNerdTutorials.com/esp32-cam-pir-motion-detector-photo-capture/

In this project, we’re going to make a motion sensor detector with photo capture using an ESP32-CAM. When your PIR sensor detects motion, it wakes up, takes a photo and saves it in the microSD card.

# ESP32-CAM Take Photo and Save to MicroSD Card

Project Page: https://RandomNerdTutorials.com/esp32-cam-take-photo-save-microsd-card/

Learn how to take photos with the ESP32-CAM board and save them to a microSD card using Arduino IDE. When you press the ESP32-CAM RESET button, it wakes up, takes a photo and saves it in the microSD card.

# ESP32-CAM Take Photo and Display in Web Server

Project Page: https://RandomNerdTutorials.com/esp32-cam-take-photo-display-web-server/

Build a web server with the ESP32-CAM board to take a photo and visualize the latest captured photo in your browser saved in SPIFFS. You can also rotate the image if necessary.

# ESP32-CAM Post Images to Local or Cloud Server using PHP (Photo Manager)

Learn how to make HTTP POST requests using the ESP32-CAM board with Arduino IDE to send photos to a server. We’ll show how to post a JPG/JPEG image to a local server (Raspberry Pi LAMP server) or to a cloud server (that you can access from anywhere). The photos will be displayed on a gallery where you can view or delete the photos. To save the images in the server and create the gallery, we'll use PHP scripts.
