# ESP32-CAM Post Images to Local or Cloud Server using PHP (Photo Manager)

Learn how to make HTTP POST requests using the ESP32-CAM board with Arduino IDE to send photos to a server. We’ll show how to post a JPG/JPEG image to a local server (Raspberry Pi LAMP server) or to a cloud server (that you can access from anywhere). The photos will be displayed on a gallery where you can view or delete the photos. To save the images in the server and create the gallery, we'll use PHP scripts.
